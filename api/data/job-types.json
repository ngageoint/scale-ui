            "description": "The Landsat 8 satellite images the entire Earth every 16 days in an 8-day offset from Landsat 7. Data collected by the instruments onboard the satellite are available to download at no charge from GloVis, EarthExplorer, or via the LandsatLook Viewer within 24 hours of reception. Landsat 8 carries two instruments: The Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor includes refined heritage bands, along with three new bands: a deep blue band for coastal/aerosol studies, a shortwave infrared band for cirrus detection*, and a Quality Assessment band. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) provides two thermal bands. These sensors both provide improved signal-to-noise (SNR) radiometric performance quantized over a 12-bit dynamic range. (This translates into 4096 potential grey levels in an image compared with only 256 grey levels in previous 8-bit instruments.) Improved signal to noise performance enable better characterization of land cover state and condition. Products are delivered as 16-bit images (scaled to 55,000 grey levels).",

            "description": "The algorithm determines the spectral similarity between two spectra by calculating the angle between the spectra. This technique, developed by J.W. Boardman, determines the spectral similarity between given reference spectra, r, (i.e., the image endmember in this case) and the spectra found at each pixel, t (Kruse, et al., 1992). The result of the comparison is reported as the angular difference (in radians) between the two spectra. Each pair of spectra is treated as a vector in nb-space, allowing the similarity of the spectra to be determined without regard to their relative brightness values. The result of the SAM calculation is an image for each reference spectrum, with high values (displayed in brighter values) corresponding to a better match between reference and test spectra.",

The Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) method is a derivative of Pearsonian Correlation Coefficient that eliminates negative correlation and maintains the SAM characteristic of minimizing the shading effect resulting in better results. The SCM varies from –1 to 1 and cos (SAM) varies from 0 to 1. Figure 1 – Graphic area in relation to the deviations beginning at x mean and y mean. Figure 2 – Exemplification of correlation: a) positive – with the major part of points presenting signals similar in relation at x mean and y mean; b) negative – with the major part of points with apposite signals in relation at x mean and y mean. The SCM algorithm method, similar to SAM, uses the reference spectrum defined by the investigator, in accordance with the image s/he wants to classify.",
